--TODO--
On each of the other two pages, 
there should be a link in the upper-right to go back to Google Search.

Query Text. On the Google Search page, the user should be able 
to type in a query, click “Google Search”, 
and be taken to the Google search results for that page.

Query Images. On the Google Image Search page, the user should 
be able to type in a query, click a search button, 
and be taken to the Google Image search results for that page.

Query Advanced. On the Google Advanced Search page, 
the user should be able to provide input for the following 
four fields (taken from Google’s own advanced search options)
Find pages with… “all these words:”
Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”
Find pages with… “any of these words:”
Find pages with… “none of these words:”

Appearance. Like Google’s own Advanced Search page, 
the four options should be stacked vertically, 
and all of the text fields should be left aligned.

Consistent with Google’s own CSS, the “Advanced Search” button 
should be blue with white text. When the “Advanced Search” button 
is clicked, the user should be taken to 
search results page for their given query.

“I’m Feeling Lucky” button onsistent with Google’s own behavior, 
clicking this link should take users directly 
to the first Google search result for the query, 
bypassing the normal results page.

Aesthetics. The CSS you write should 
match Google’s own aesthetics as best as possible.
